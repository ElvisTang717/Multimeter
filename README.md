# Multimeter

# Project Introduction
This is a digital multimeter. It has a DC measure mode and an AC measure mode. It can handle inputs between 0 and 3 volts.  It is capable of reading waves with frequency from 1-1000 Hz. It can read sin, saw-tooth, square, and triangle waves. In DC mode, it reads the voltage level and outputs the corresponding voltage to the terminal. In AC mode it reads the frequency, peak to peak voltage, RMS voltage. When outputting to the terminal the device both displays the values numerically and it displays the values on a series of bar graphs.<br />

# Accomplishments
* Created the multimeter’s AC/DC interface on Realterm through USART, USART’s interrupts.
* Calculated input signals’ Vpp and Vrms through sampling its voltages via ADC interrupt.
* Calculated the time interval between each ADC interrupt according to the frequency of the input signal to avoid over-sampling or under-sampling.
* Calculated the frequency of the input signal based on the interval between the two consecutive rising edges of the square wave that is generated by the comparator and the edges are captured by the timer’s interrupts.
* Generated the required square wave by configuring the DAC output value as the average voltage of the input signal and setting it as the reference voltage of the comparator.
